We have two files: `index.php` and `form2.php`. <br>
The `index.php` file provides the name entry screen, while `form2.php` displays the "User Profile and Interests" page. <br>
By following the detailed instructions in the `README.md` file, you can easily use this functionality. <br>
After making all the adjustemnts, this will help you connect with people who share similar interests and expand your network.
